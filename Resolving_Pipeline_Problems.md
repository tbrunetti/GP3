# INSTALLATION ISSUES

PCs table and PCA graphs won't generate
  * This error usually is a 'file not found' or 'executionHalted' error and generally is a result of one of the following issues:  
	1.  The GENESIS or GWASTools libraries in R are not loaded, installed, or the location of the libraries are not properly set
	2.  The GENESIS PC matrix was never generated because no individuals remained after filtering (change filter thresholds in pipeline to be less stringent)
	3.  The GENESIS PC matrix was never generated because not enough SNPs remained after filtering (change filter thresholds in pipeline to be less stringent).  It should be noted that the PC table generation is dependent upon the kinship files generated by the KING software.  The KING software requires >1000 SNPs remaining in order to generate a non-empty file and generate a PC matrix.
	4.  If using --TGP flag, the graph will not generate if you set the --centerPop argument to a population that does not exist in your data set.
	5.  If using --TGP flag, make sure the path to the TGP_Sub_and_SuperPopulation_info.txt file is properly set when running chunky configure.  Also, make sure the TGP FID and IID match was is in the TGP_Sub_and_SuperPopulation_info.txt file and if it is modified ensure the header remains the exact same and formatting remains the same.
	6.  If using --TGP flag, check each group's subdierectoy generated by the pipeline and make sure any /*.missnp files do not exist.  If so resolve these issues.  This is a file generated by plink when merging TGP with the group.  Any snps in this file mean there is a discordance between your input data and the TGP data for that SNP.  i.e. they need to be flipped or removed from the dataset.  Make sure all the SNP names match between your input set and the TGP set.
